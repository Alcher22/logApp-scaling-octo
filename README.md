 > **NAME**

Build an HTML form to insert data in a database in PHP MySQL

 > **DESCRIPTION**


In this article, we are going to see how a form is made and how the details entered by the user are stored in a database. As we code along, we are going to create a webpage which has a form and we will store the entries in a table in a database.

You will learn:

basic ideas like database, table, primary key
post API and insertion in a database table
setting up a server, database, connecting your application and inserting data through a form
The technology stack used for backend in this article is PHP with a MySQL database. For front end, we will use easy and self-explanatory HTML.

<b>How to Install phpMyAdmin on Your Windows PC</b>

1
Make sure that you've installed Apache, PHP, and MySQL. Apache, PHP, and MySQL must all be installed and configured on your computer before you can install phpMyAdmin in this way.

2
Open the phpMyAdmin download page. Go to https://www.phpmyadmin.net/ in your browser.

3
Click Download. It's a green button in the upper-right side of the page. The phpMyAdmin ZIP folder will begin downloading onto your computer.
You'll also see the version number next to Download (e.g., for the November 2017 version of phpMyAdmin, you'd click Download 4.7.5)

4
Click Close when prompted. This will return you to the phpMyAdmin webpage.

5
Open the phpMyAdmin folder. Double-click the downloaded phpMyAdmin ZIP folder to do so.

6
Copy the phpMyAdmin folder's contents. Click the regular phpMyAdmin folder in the ZIP folder's window, then press Ctrl+C.

7
Go to your Apache host folder. This is typically a folder named "htdocs" inside of the "Apache" folder, which should be located in the "C:" folder on your hard drive.
The Apache host folder usually has a text document named "index.php" or something similar.
The fastest way to get to this folder is by clicking This PC on the left side of the window, double-clicking the Apache folder, and double-clicking the htdocs (or similar) folder.

8
Paste the copied folder into the host folder. Press Ctrl+V to paste the copied phpMyAdmin folder into the Apache host folder.

9
Change the copied folder's name to phpmyadmin. Click the phpMyAdmin folder, click Home, click Rename in the toolbar, type phpmyadmin into the folder's name field, and press â†µ Enter.

10
Open the PHP folder. This folder is located in the "C:" folder along with the "Apache" folder. Once you find the PHP folder, double-click it to open it.
